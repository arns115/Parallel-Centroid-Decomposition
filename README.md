# Parallel-Centroid-Decomposition (OpenMP)
A parallel version of the algorithm Centroid Decomposition using the OpenMP library for C++.
Both serial and parallel versions are included.\
To use this program, one must first run generateData. After that, one may run both centroidDecomp and centroidDecompParallel.\
Finally, graphs.py and test.py will plot the graphs and validate the results respectively. \
One can change the number of tests by modyfing the T value at the top of generateData, CentroidDecomp and centroidDecompParallel.
